## ⚡ THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DO RIGHT NOW

### Step 1: Upload Files to Your Hosting (10 minutes)

Your hosting provider gave you a control panel (cPanel, Plesk, etc.). You need to upload 2 files:

1. **robots.txt** ← Upload to root folder
2. **sitemap.xml** ← Upload to root folder

**If you don't know how:**
- Contact your hosting provider support (they're free)
- Say: "I need to upload files to my root directory"
- They'll show you how

**Without this step, Google won't find your sitemap!**

### Step 2: Submit Sitemap to Google (5 minutes)

1. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Login with your Google Account
3. Add your website
4. Click "Sitemaps" (left menu)
